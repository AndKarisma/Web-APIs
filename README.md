# Unit 04: Web APIs

## Overview
Built in to every browser are methods and properties that allow us to extend its basic functionality using JavaScript. This is an example of an application programming interface, or API. APIs are central to creating dynamic, interactive web applications. The first, and perhaps most important, API we will work with is the Web API, which interfaces with the browser. 

In the previous unit, you worked with the `Window` object to generate alerts and prompts in the browser. If you inspect the `Window` object in your developer tools, you'll see that it contains many properties and methods in addition to the ones you’re familiar with. The `Window` object is only one of dozens of interfaces we can access in the Web API, so you can probably imagine the functionality available to us if we've only seen the tip of the iceberg so far!  

We will look at a few of the most important Web APIs in this unit, beginning with the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is an in-memory object-oriented representation of an HTML document, which allows us to interact with HTML using JavaScript. When we interface with the DOM, we are not making any changes to the HTML document itself—only to its representation as an object in the browser. DOM methods allow us to select elements to get content from them or insert content into them, generate new elements, and listen for and respond to events such as key presses and mouse clicks.
